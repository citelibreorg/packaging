**CiteLibre** is the software suite provided by the City of Paris to help you implement a wide range of digital services ready for deployment with your brand image.

Benefit from the City of Paris service packs already available free of charge, with new ones that will focus on citizen participation coming soon. These services are developed on the Lutece platform, pre-assembled and containerized for easy deployment, and 100% open source.

The services are based on the latest versions of the required plugins and the latest version of the Lutece core project which gathers all common features to run a Lutece-based website (front and back office, user management, role-based access controls, ...)

== 🔧 Getting Started

Any CiteLibre service can be started with docker compose.

=== CiteLibre backbone
First of all, you need to run the common platform that holds third party components such as Keycloak, Kibana/ES, Matomo, Solr, etc...

[source,bash]
----
docker compose -f citelibre-platform/docker-compose.yml up [-d]
----

You can then access the following service interfaces

- **Matomo** is used to store and display web and app analytics (http://localhost/matomo: admin/adminadmin)
- **Adminer** to easily access and interact with the application data (http://localhost/adminer?server=rendezvous-db&username=citelibre&db=rendezvous password: rdv)
- **Keycloak** to manage front-end and back-end authentication and single sign-on (http://localhost/keycloak/admin: admin/admin1234)
- **Elasticsearch** to store all business-related app data (http://localhost/elasticsearch)
- **Kibana** to display business analytics dashboards (http://localhost/kibana: lutece/RKOmBI1sWaa*SFm1gx*H)

Or simply go to http://localhost/ that will show a Portal to all deployed applications.

=== Launch a CiteLibre RendezVous instance

Currently, as **CiteLibre RendezVous** first version hasn't been released officially (it will in a few weeks though :)), you need to build its Docker image in order to run it.
To build and launch from the source code, please refer to 🧩 Packaging a CiteLibre digital service.

Once it is released, the image will be hosted on DockerHub. You'll simply have to type the following command to download it and launch it.

[source,bash]
